    Once upon a time, there was a little prince who lived in a very small world.
      <hr>The world was inhabited only by the prince and a rose. The prince loved the
      <hr> rose very much and cared for it madly. But little by little the rose asked the
      <hr> prince for more things and more care. Not knowing what to do, the little
      <hr> prince decided to explore other worlds, leaving the rose alone.
